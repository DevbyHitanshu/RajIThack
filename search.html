                        <h5>The French Revolution and the Idea of the Nation
                        </h5>
                        <p>"The first clear expression of nationalism came with
                            the French Revolution in 1789. France, as you
                            would remember, was a full-fledged territorial state
                            in 1789 under the rule of an absolute monarch.
                            The political and constitutional changes that came
                            in the wake of the French Revolution led to the
                            transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a
                            body of French citizens. The revolution proclaimed
                            that it was the people who would henceforth
                            constitute the nation and shape its destiny.
                            From the very beginning, the French revolutionaries
                            introduced various measures and practices that
                            could create a sense of collective identity amongst
                            the French people. The ideas of la patrie (the
                            fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised
                            the notion of a united community enjoying equal rights under a
                            constitution. A new French flag, the tricolour, was chosen to replace
                            the former royal standard. 
                            Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken
                            and written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.
                            The revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the
                            destiny of the French nation to liberate the peoples of Europe
                            from despotism, in other words to help other peoples of Europe
                            to become nations.
                            
                            However, in the areas conquered, the reactions of the local
                            populations to French rule were mixed. Initially, in many places such
                            as Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like Brussels,
                            Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as
                            harbingers of liberty. But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility,
                            as it became clear that the new administrative arrangements did not
                            go hand in hand with political freedom. Increased taxation,
                            censorship, forced conscription into the French armies required to
                            conquer the rest of Europe, all seemed to outweigh the advantages
                            of the administrative changes."

#This is how it work's
1. Enter a query: The user enters a query about a topic they want to learn more about.
2. The natural language processing algorithms analyze the query and generate a list of potential topics for the user to learn more about.
3. Record your teacherâ€™s lecture with the IOT audio recorder, then the audio is converted to text using NLTK and feed to knowledge graph.
4. The user is presented with a list of topics and can select which one they would like to learn more about.

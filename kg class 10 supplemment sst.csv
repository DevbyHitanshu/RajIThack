0,RISE OF NATIONALISM,Chapter name
0.1,Introduction,"Frédéric Sorrieu, a French artist, in 1848 prepared a series of four prints visualising his
dream of a world made up of democratic and Social Republics.
The first print shows the people of Europe and America marching in a long train and
offering homage to the Statue of Liberty as they pass it. The torch of Enlightenment
was carried by a female figure in one hand and the Charter of the Rights of Man in
the other.
On the earth in the foreground lie the shattered remains of the symbols of absolutist
institutions.
In Sorrieu’s utopian vision, the people of the world are grouped as distinct nations,
identified through their flags and national costume.
The procession was led by the United States and Switzerland, followed by France
and Germany. Following the German people are the people of Austria, the Kingdom
of the Two Sicilies, Lombardy, Poland, England, Ireland, Hungary and Russia.
. From the heavens above, Christ, saints and angels gaze upon the scene. They
have been used by the artist to symbolise fraternity among the nations of the world.
During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a force which brought huge
changes in the political and mental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was
the emergence of the nation-state."
1,The French Revolution and the Idea of the Nation,"In 1789 Nationalism came with French Revolution and the political and constitutional
changes led to the transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a body of French
citizens. Various measures and practices were introduced such as the ideas of la
patrie (the fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen). A new French flag, the tricolour was to replace the former one
Democracy destroyed in France by Napoleon and the Civil Code of 1804 known as
Napoleonic Code did away with all privileges based on birth, established equality
before the law and secured the right to property"
2,The Making of Nationalism in Europe,"Germany, Italy and Switzerland were divided into kingdoms, duchies and cantons whose rulers had their autonomous territories."
2.1,The Aristocracy and the New Middle Class,"The Aristocracy was the dominant class on the continent politically and socially. The
majority of the population was made up of the peasantry. Industrialisation began in England in the second half of the eighteenth century. New social groups came into being: a working-class population and middle classes made up of industrialist, businessmen, professionals."
2.2,What did Liberal Nationalism Stand for?,"The term ‘liberalism’ derives from the Latin root liber, meaning free. The right to vote
and to get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men. Men without
property and all women were excluded from political rights
In 1834, a customs union or zollverein was formed at the initiative of Prussia and
joined by most of the German states. The union abolished tariff barriers and
reduced the number of currencies from over thirty to two."
2.3,A New Conservatism after 1815,"In 1815, European governments were driven by a spirit of conservatism.
Conservatives believed in monarchy, the Church, social hierarchies, property and
that the family should be preserved.
A modern army, an efficient bureaucracy, a dynamic economy, the abolition of
feudalism and serfdom could strengthen the autocratic monarchies of Europe
In 1815, representatives of the European powers – Britain, Russia, Prussia and
Austria met in Vienna to draw up a settlement for Europe.
 The Bourbon dynasty was restored to power and France lost the territories it had
annexed under Napoleon.
The major issues taken up by the liberal-nationalists, who criticised the new
conservative order, was freedom of the press."
2.4,The Revolutionaries,"In 1815, secret societies were formed in many European states to train
revolutionaries and spread their ideas. Revolutionary opposed monarchical forms,
fight for liberty and freedom.
The Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini, born in Genoa in 1807, founded two
more underground societies, first, Young Italy in Marseilles.
Secondly, he founded Young Europe in Berne, whose members were like-minded
young men from Poland, France, Italy and the German states"
3,The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848,"In July 1830, Bourbon Kings were overthrown by liberal revolutionaries who installed
a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its head. The July Revolution sparked
an uprising in Brussels which led to Belgium breaking away from the United Kingdom
of the Netherlands. In 1821, Greeks struggled for independence. "
3.1,The Romantic Imagination and National Feeling,"Culture played an important role in creating the idea of the nation: art and poetry, stories
and music helped express and shape nationalist feelings.
Romanticism, a cultural movement which sought to develop a particular form of nationalist
sentiment. Language also played an important role in developing nationalist sentiments.
Russian language was imposed everywhere and in 1831 an armed rebellion against
Russian rule took place which was ultimately crushed"
3.2,"Hunger, Hardship and Popular Revolt","Europe faced economic hardships in the 1830s. The first half of the nineteenth century saw
an enormous increase in population all over Europe. The rise of food prices or a year of
bad harvest led to widespread pauperism in town and country. In 1848, food shortages and
widespread unemployment brought the population of Paris out on the roads."
3.3,The Revolution of the Liberals,"In 1848, a revolution led by the educated middle classes was underway. Men and women
of the liberal middle class demanded creation of a nation-state on parliamentary principles
– a constitution, freedom of the press and freedom of association.
A large number of political associations came together in Frankfurt to vote for an allGerman National Assembly. On 18 May 1848, 831 elected representatives marched to
take their places in the Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of St Paul.
The Constitution drafted for German nation was headed by a monarchy, subject to a
Parliament. The Crown was offered to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia but he rejected
it and joined other monarchs to oppose the elected assembly. The Middle Class dominated
the Parliament and a large number of women participated in liberal movement.
Women formed their own political associations, founded newspapers and took part in
political meetings and demonstrations, but they were still denied suffrage rights during the
election of the Assembly.
In the years after 1848, the autocratic monarchies of Central and Eastern Europe began to
introduce the changes that had already taken place in Western Europe before 1815. Thus,
serfdom and bonded labour were abolished both in the Habsburg dominions and in
Russia. "
4,The Making of Germany and Italy,
4.1,Germany – Can the Army be the Architect of a Nation?,"Nationalism in Europe moved away after 1848 and Germany and Italy came to be unified
as nation-states. Prussia took over the leadership of the movement for national unification.
The architect of this process was its chief minister, Otto von Bismarck, carried out with the
help of the Prussian army and bureaucracy.
In January 1871, the Prussian King, William I, was proclaimed German Emperor. An
assembly was held to proclaim the new German Empire. The process of nation-building
demonstrated the dominance of Prussian state power. The currency, banking, legal and
judicial system in Germany were modernised. "
4.2,Italy Unified,"Italy was divided into seven states, in the middle of the nineteenth century, and among all
the seven states, Sardinia-Piedmont, was ruled by an Italian princely house. All the regions
were dominated by different kings. In the 1830's Giuseppe Mazzini formed a secret society
called Young Italy.
The movement was led by Chief Minister Cavour. In 1859, Sardinia-Piedmont defeated
Austrian forces. In 1860, they marched into South Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies
and succeeded in winning the support of the local peasants. In 1861 Victor Emmanuel II
was proclaimed king of united Italy."
4.3,The Strange Case of Britain,"Great Britain was the model of the nation and prior to the eighteenth century there was no
British nation. The nation became powerful as it steadily grew in wealth, importance and
power. The Act of Union (1707) between England and Scotland resulted in the formation of
the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’ meant, in effect, that England was able to impose its
influence on Scotland. In 1801, Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom.
The symbols of the new Britain – the British flag (Union Jack), the national anthem (God
Save Our Noble King), the English language – were actively promoted. "
5,Visualising the Nation,"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries artists represented a country as a person and
nations as female figures. During the French Revolution, female figures portray ideas such
as Liberty, Justice and the Republic. Liberty is represented as a red cap, or the broken
chain, Justice a blindfolded woman carrying a pair of weighing scales"
6,Nationalism and Imperialism,"Nationalism no longer retained after the last quarter of the nineteenth century. After 1871,
the most tensioned area was called the Balkans a region comprising modern-day
Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia,
Serbia and Montenegro.
Ottoman Empire made the Balkans region explosive and all through the nineteenth century
they strengthened themselves through modernisation and internal reforms. Due to various
conflicts the Balkan became an area of intense conflict.
During this period, intense rivalry built among the European powers over trade and
colonies as well as naval and military might which led to a series of wars in the region and
finally the First World War.
In 1914, Europe was disastered because of Nationalism, aligned with imperialism. Antiimperial movements were developed but they all struggled to form independent nationstates. But the idea of ‘nation-states’ was accepted as natural and universal."
